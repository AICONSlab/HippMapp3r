## QC
QC files are automatically generated for some commands in a sub-folder within the subject folder.
QC files can also be created through the GUI or command line.
QC files are .png images that show a series of slices in the brain to
help you quickly evaluate if your command worked successfully,
especially if you have run multiple subjects.


## Logs
Log files are automatically generated in a sub-folder within the subject folder.
They are .txt files that contain information regarding the command
and can be useful if something did not work successfully.
