# Getting started

You can use HippMapp3r through the graphical user interface (GUI) or command line:

## For GUI

To start the GUI, type

    hippmapper

A GUI that looks like the image below should appear. You can hover any of buttons in the GUI to see a brief description of the command.

## For Command Line

You can see all the hippmapper commands by typing either of the following lines:

    hippmapper -h
    hippmapper --help

Once you know the command you want to know from the list, you can see more information about the command. For example, to learn more about seg_hfb:

    hippmapper seg_hipp -h
    hippmapper seg_hipp --help

## Hippocampal volumes
To extract hippocampal volumes use the GUI (Stats/Hippocampal Volumes) or command line:

    hippmapper stats_hp -h

## QC
QC files are automatically generated in a sub-folder within the subject folder.
They are .png images that show a series of slices in the brain to
help you quickly evaluate if your command worked successfully,
especially if you have run multiple subjects.
They can also be created through the GUI or command line:

    hippmapper seg_qc -h

The QC image should look like this:

## Logs
Log files are automatically generated in a sub-folder within the subject folder.
They are .txt files that contain information regarding the command
and can be useful if something did not work successfully.
