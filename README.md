# HippMapp3r

*HippMapp3r* (pronounced hippmapper) is a CNN-based segmentation technique of the whole hippocampus
using MRI images from BrainLab.
It can deal with brains with extensive atrophy and segments the hippocampi in seconds.
It uses a T1-weighted image as the only input and segments both with-skull and skull-stripped images.
